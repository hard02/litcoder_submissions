Problem Statement

Sum of Numbers With Units Digit K

You are given two integers, num and k. You need to find the minimum possible size of a set of positive integers with the following properties:

    Each integer in the set has the unit digit equal to k.
    The sum of all the integers in the set equals num.

If such a set exists, return its minimum size. Otherwise, if no set satisfies the conditions, return -1.

Note:
The set can contain multiple instances of the same integer, and if the set is empty, its sum is considered to be 0.
The unit digit of a number refers to its rightmost digit.
Consider the input:

num = 58
k = 9

The function should return 2 because there exists a valid set with two positive integers, both having the units digit 9, and their sum is equal to 58.

Important Note: Ensure that you save your solution before progressing to the next question and  before submitting your answer.
