Sudoku board validation algorithm

You have been tasked with developing an algorithm to validate a 9 x 9 Sudoku board. Your algorithm needs to verify the validity of the filled cells on the board, adhering to the following conditions:

Every row should contain the numbers 1-9 exactly once, without repetition.
Every column should contain the numbers 1-9 exactly once, without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes within the grid should contain the numbers 1-9 exactly once, without repetition.

Can you outline an algorithm or a step-by-step approach to determine if the given Sudoku board configuration is valid based on these conditions?

Important Note: Ensure that you save your solution before progressing to the next question and  before submitting your answer.
