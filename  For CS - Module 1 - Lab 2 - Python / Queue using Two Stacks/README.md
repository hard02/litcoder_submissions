Queue

Write a program to implement a custom queue using two stacks. The queue should support the following three types of queries:
Enqueue: This query type is denoted by "1 x", where x is an element to be enqueued. It means that you need to insert element x at the end of the queue.
Dequeue: This query type is denoted by "2". It indicates that you should remove the element at the front of the queue.
Print Front: This query type is denoted by "3". It instructs you to print the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
