Longest Substring

You are tasked with developing a function that finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string s. Consider different scenarios involving various characters in the input string.

Scenario: String with No Repeating Characters
Input: "abcdef"
Expected Output: 6
Explanation: In this scenario, the input string contains no repeating characters, so the entire string itself is the longest substring without repeating characters.

Scenario: String with Repeating Characters
Input: "abccba"
Expected Output: 3
Explanation: In this case, the longest substring without repeating characters is "abc" with a length of 3. The characters 'c' and 'b' are repeated, so the substring ends at the first occurrence of the repeated character
