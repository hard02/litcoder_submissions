Contiguous Array

Given a binary array 'nums', you are required to find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray that contains an equal number of 0s and 1s.

Explanation:

    A binary array is an array that contains only 0s and 1s.
    A subarray is any subset of the indices of the original array.
    A contiguous subarray is a subarray in which all the elements are consecutive, i.e., any element between the first and last element of the subarray is also part of it.

Examples:
Input		:nums = [0, 1]
Output	: 2
Explanation: The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is [0, 1] with a length of 2.
Input		: nums = [0, 1, 0]
Output	: 2
Explanation: The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is either [0, 1] or [1, 0], both with a length of 2.
Input		: nums = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
Output	: 6
Explanation: The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1] with a length of 6.
The problem requires finding the maximum length of a contiguous subarray in the binary array 'nums' that contains an equal number of 0s and 1s.
